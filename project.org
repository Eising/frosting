#+TITLE: TODO for the project

* Milestone 1

** TODO Port all validators from viconf
   I have a lot of regex-based validators in place already in viconf. These
   should be easy to migrate.

** TODO  Implement range-based validation
   Integer-range based validation is handy for e.g. VLANs.

** TODO Implement JSON-based service structures

** DONE Implement more simple types
   CLOSED: [2018-11-26 Mon 16:02]
   I think numbers/integers is the only one here, but maybe others can come?
   Update: IntergerInput has been implemented with a limit option

** TODO Migrate tester.py as unit tests

* Milestone 2

** TODO Implement an HTML exporter
   This should make it easy to integrate in web-based framework

* Milestone 3
** TODO Implement a simple integrated CLI
