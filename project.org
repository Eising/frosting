#+TITLE: TODO for the project

* Milestone 1

** TODO Port all validators from viconf
   I have a lot of regex-based validators in place already in viconf. These
   should be easy to migrate.

** TODO  Implement range-based validation
   Integer-range based validation is handy for e.g. VLANs.

** TODO Implement JSON-based service structures

** TODO Implement more simple types
   I think numbers/integers is the only one here, but maybe others can come?

* Milestone 2

** TODO Implement an HTML exporter
   This should make it easy to integrate in web-based framework

* Milestone 3
** TODO Implement a simple integrated CLI
